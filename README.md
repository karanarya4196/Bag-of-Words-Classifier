A micro-model developed for the binary classfication of violated invoices which otherwise could not be captured in the overall model. Based on the concept of bigrams and trigrams, a feature set is prepared to understand the sequences and frequencies of invoice descriptions. The feature set is later trained and classified on RandomForestClassifier.
